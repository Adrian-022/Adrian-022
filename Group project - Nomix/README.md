This is the project we,as a class did in our IGCSE 2 year, it is effectively a text-based economic simulator game. The goal of the game is to survive for as long as 
possible while your people use up your resources, as dissasters make it difficult destroying some of your building, resources, people, money, or happiness that is needed to keep
people coming to your city and make sure the ones you have do not leave.

This is one of the very few group projects we did, and by far the most complicated.

To run the code you will need something that is able to run visual basic such as microsoft visual basic code.
I have included the project in a aplication format that you can simply play and see what the code does however u wont be able to change the code for it.
